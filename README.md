# Eniac-Magist-Case
## Data Science Case from WBS Coding School using SQL and Tableau

Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in high-end tech products, is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. The problem for Eniac is that the company doesn’t have ties with local providers, package delivery services, or customer service agencies. Therefore they are considering working with Magist, a Brazilian Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. In addition, Magist provides after-sales services such as stock and warehouse management, product shipment, and customer service related to the shipment.

To decide if there is a good strategic fit between Eniac and Magist the data department (= the data science students) was asked to evaluate Magist's database along the following questions:

1. In relation to the products:
What categories of tech products does Magist have?
How many products of these tech categories have been sold (within the time window of the database snapshot)? What percentage does that represent from the overall number of products sold?
What’s the average price of the products being sold?
Are expensive tech products popular?

2. In relation to the sellers:
How many months of data are included in the magist database?
How many sellers are there? How many Tech sellers are there? What percentage of overall sellers are Tech sellers?
What is the total amount earned by all sellers? What is the total amount earned by all Tech sellers?
Can you work out the average monthly income of all sellers? Can you work out the average monthly income of Tech sellers?

3. In relation to the delivery time:
What’s the average time between the order being placed and the product being delivered?
How many orders are delivered on time vs orders delivered with a delay?
Is there any pattern for delayed orders, e.g. big products being delayed more often?

The task was to use SQL for data analysis and tableau for data visualization. The results had to be presented in a 5 min presentation which can be found here.
